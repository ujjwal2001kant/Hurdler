# Pathfinder Visualiser


Hello everyone, this is a visualiser tool for Pathfinding algorithms. I built it beacuse I love getting my hands on algorithms and hope you enjoy playing with it too!

<h2>What's Next </h2>

-- I plan on adding a speed feature to let you control the speed of the visualisation process.

-- Add more algorithms as well as obstacles such as Maze to the project to get a deeper grasp over the concept.


<i> Let me know if you have any suggestions/ changes you would like to see in the application.
